# PulseCanvas
ðŸŽ¨ðŸ”µðŸ”ƒ Interactive art project with colorful bouncing circles created using HTML5 canvas. This project was designed as a learning experience, showcasing dynamic visual effects and mouse interactivity.<br><br>

<p>
In this project, I utilized the HTML5 canvas element to create an interactive art experience. The foundation of the project involved drawing and animating bouncing circles on the canvas.<br>
I implemented mouse interaction to dynamically change the size of the circles based on proximity.<br>
The colors of the circles were randomly generated using JavaScript.<br>
The project was developed as an opportunity for learning and experimentation with canvas animation techniques, interactivity, and JavaScript programming.<br></p>
